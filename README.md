### Installing Python
Python is the programming language that the bot was written in.
The first step is to figure out if you have an AMD or Intel processor. You can figure out which one you have by following the steps on this website:

If you have an AMD processor, then download: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/python-3.5.1-amd64.exe

If you have an Intel processor, then download: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/python-3.5.1.exe

### Installing Selenium
Selenium is a codebase that this bot relies on to run. It can be installed to Python by first opening up the start menu and typing in 'cmd' (without the quotation marks). Right click on the program and press 'Run as administrator'. Finally, type in:
> pip install -U selenium

and press enter. Once it finishes installing, restart your computer.

### Running The Setup File
