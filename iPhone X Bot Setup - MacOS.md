# iPhone X Bot Setup - MacOS
**Before setting up the bot, please go to your Apple account and add your credit card information as well as your shipping information. This is so the bot can check you out faster!**

### Installing Python
Python is the programming language that the bot was written in.
Download the latest version from this link: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.3/python-3.6.3-macosx10.6.pkg

Install it, then restart your computer.

### Installing Selenium
Selenium is a codebase that this bot relies on to run. In the upper right of the screen, press on the magnifying glass to search for an app. Type in
> terminal

and press enter. Type in:
> pip3 install selenium

and press enter. Once it finishes installing, restart your computer.

Finally, download this file: https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.33/chromedriver_mac64.zip
and then extract this file into the directory where the scripts are.

### Running The Setup File
Open up the folder containing all the files. Right click the file called *setup.py* and navigate to 'Open with', and press 'IDLE'. Follow the setup instructions. Then head to Run > Run Module in order to run the script. **Please double check that the information you entered is correct.**

### Running The Bot
**Right before the preorder starts** Navigate to where you stored 'main.py', and open it. When the preorder goes live, go to Run > Run Module. Let the bot order the iPhone for you!

Please run the bot before the preorder goes live to make sure that it loads up the browser. The bot should not work yet, because the preorders haven't gone live.

Note: If the bot pauses, for longer than 20 seconds, then please continue the pre-order manually. This shouldn't happen because Apple's servers are very good, especially on pre-order pages.
